sustainable farm

organic agriculture
	
the placechosen for this farm Brazil , because of their strategic importance, knowing that the sun is essential for good development.
Without any use of pesticides, we rely on soil treatment techniques and daily monitoring and special care, but I can prove that these chemicals are not needed to speed up the process and we also have to offer the best for those who need it.
Treat the land and enrich it with nutrients a few days of preparation and then start planting  

I did some tests and I could see that a plant develops better with the exact amount of water, neither little nor much has an exact amount to produce and speed up the processes
	
Special care with the plant is very important, a few days without treating the plant you can lose almost everything that has already been done. We have to keep the daily care to have a good result.

a sustainable farm can offer a lot to lives that are physically hungry and lives that are hungry for a positive experience , vacancies for volunteer workers an opportunity to live on the 
farm for time helping with all processes I want to show volunteers that money can not bring the benefits of a love a job well done and not to gain paper but to help lives I want to help because God taught me the truth and set me free
